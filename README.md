We were interested in finding an appropriate copula, Student's t or Gaussian, to forecast downward risk and diversification benefits.
We obtained the dataset from Dr. Erik Kole, author of "Selecting copulas for risk management" (2007). We visually assessed copula fit to 
stock, bonds and real estate returns data as well as performed goodness of fit tests to quantitatively assess fit. Techniques like 
simulations were performed along with White test and the Anderson-Darling test. We concluded that Student's t copula better fits 
returns data than the Gaussian copula and measures dependency in both tails and the central distribution thus accounting for both risk 
and safe investments, respectively. (See the FinalHandout and FinalPresentation for further information and Code for an overview of 
the statistical techniques used in R).
